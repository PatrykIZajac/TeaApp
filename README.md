# TeaApp | Flutter

[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android_Studio-4.0-green.svg)](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

The application is an imitation of an online store in the mobile application version. I wrote this project in order to learn basic state management and local database operations and basic CRUD operations.
